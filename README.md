web API

NWU Tech Trends requires a solution that can identify how much time is saved every time an automation that Tech Trends created has run. The time saved should be associated to a cost and should be grouped by project and client. This can be done through the use of telemetry which would be embedded in an automation. Every time the automation kicks off, the telemetry is recorded. This can be done through a REST API.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a model and architectural style for web services over HTTP. NWU Tech Trends services can be managed using the cloud when this model is used for API design. Therefore, the NWU Tech Trends Management System should be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs.   
RESTful APIs and services are used as a good practice in the industry to transport data between systems, environments, interfaces and applications. One of the most common use cases is connecting a RESTful API to a data source to manage interaction with the data source. This approach lends many advantages to a solution mostly addressing longevity. RESTful APIs commonly consist of CRUD methods that allow for retrieval of data and manipulation of data (create, read, update and delete).
